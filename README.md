# ThisYearGiantBomb
A RSS feed styled XML file containing the episodes of the now defunct This Year podcast centering on the Giant Bombcast.

It is recommended to host this file via a nginx docker container to enable your podcast client of choice to pull the needed data to download episodes. Consider renaming the file to index.html to remove a potential layer of issues. All content is hosted on archive.org.

Overcast users: Be aware that you appear to have to resolve the FULL url to get the app to accept the address. eg- http://[IPAddress]/bombcast.xml
